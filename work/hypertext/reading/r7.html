<p>The inward turn: consciousness and the text</p>
<span class="q4high quote">Since at least the time of Hegel, awareness has been growing that human consciousness evolves.</span> Although being human means being a person and thus being unique and induplicable, growth in historical knowledge has made it apparent that the way in which a person feels himself or herself in the cosmos has evolved in a patterned fashion over the ages. <span class="q4high quote">Modern studies in the shift from orality to literacy and the sequels of literacy, print and the electronic processing of verbalization, make more and more apparent some of the ways in which this evolution has depended on writing.</span>
<p>The evolution of consciousness through human history is marked by growth in articulate attention to the interior of the individual person as distanced—though not necessarily separated—from the communal structures in which each person is necessarily enveloped. Self-consciousness is coextensive with humanity; everyone who can say ‘I’ has an acute sense of self. But reflectiveness and articulateness about the self takes time to grow. Short-term developments show its growth: the crises in Euripides’ plays are less crises of social expectations and more crises of interior conscience than are the crises in the plays of the earlier tragedian Aeschylus. Longer-term developments show a similar growth in explicit philosophical concern with the self, which becomes noticeable in Kant, central in Fichte, obtrusive in Kierkegaard, and pervasive in twentieth-century existentialists and personalists. In The Inward Turn of Narrative (1973) Erich Kahler has reported in detail the way in which narrative in the west becomes more and more preoccupied with and articulate about inner, personal crises. The stages of consciousness described in a Jungian framework by Erich Neumann in The Origins and History of Consciousness (1954) move toward a self-conscious, articulate, highly personal, interiority.</p>
