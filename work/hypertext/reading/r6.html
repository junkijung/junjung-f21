Networked hypertext became a unifying global format for the inscription and transmission of information largely because of the ingenuity and social principles of Tim Berners-Lee, who developed the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) while working as a researcher at the CERN physics laboratory in Switzerland in the 1980s, and created the world’s first HTML website in August 1991. Berners-Lee wanted to make It easier for researchers to share documents loaded on servers, which was then done with the file transfer protocol (FTP). To FTP a file required specialized software and the file itself was not viewable until it was opened in whatever software had created it. There were passwords involved in each transaction and the transferred files might not display properly on the recipient’s machine. Berners-Lee’s standardized markup language and system of the net addresses (the URL, or universal resource locator) made it easier to find the right document on the right machine and to display it in readable form on any platform. Most importantly, HTML included a tagging convention for turning any part of the document into a link, eliminating the need for securing and typing in a URL for every file you wanted to view, and providing a uniform transmission code for hypertext.
<p>One of the crucial elements in a hypertext system is that it eliminates one or more layers of distracting transmission code. In a library we have to translate our request into a call number and the call number into a location on a shelf. In a book index we have to translate our interest area into possible key words, look up variants of the key words in an index, follow the index pointer to a particular page and search the page for the related material. In a hypertext system the indexed key words are the pointers and the URL is hidden in the source code. The link is a powerful new kind of label, unique to computational environments: it can function as an identifier, descriptor, address, and as a means of directly retrieving the information it identifies, describes, and points to.</p>
<p>Because of the organizing power of the link, the value of hyperlinked information rests on the quality of the words and images used as pointers, the semantic descriptor that is enclosed within the linking tag and displayed as an underlined or colored link. These labels that we apply to URLs are taking the place of the library catalog and shelving system. But the catalog and shelving system are professionalized classification practices with over a century of information design behind them. By contrast a link in a hypertext system may or may not be under editorial control, and is part of an open, universally available, information structure with only a few decades worth of practice behind it. Among the clearest symptoms of this immaturity is the persistence of “Links” as a section of a website. This was understandable given the novelty of hyperlinks, but “Links” is no more descriptive than “Names” or “Addresses” or “Books.” A link is merely a pointer; the user needs to know what kinds of things are being pointed to under this heading.</p>
<p>HTML also included other kinds of tags besides links, directing the browser how to display the information. Some tags indicated elements directly, such as the horizontal rule tag, some gave formatting instructions, such as the tags for italics or bold text or a bulleted or numbered list; and some gave formatting instructions less directly through structural labels, such as heading1 or heading2. The information was presented as a document structured by the tags.</p>
