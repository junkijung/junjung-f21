Similarly, textual technology is not simply a tool but the mode by which we engage the world and produce a sense of selfhood. Basing his ideas on the work of One and Eric Havelock, Heim describes “the theory of transformative technologies,” which identifies major shifts in textual technology as occurring with the emergence of chirographic—or hand-writing—culture from one that was predominantly oral, the development of typographic culture with the invention of the printing press, and the development of word-precessing and electronically networked textuality that is emerging at the present time. (When Heim discusses “word processing” he normally does so with the assumption that anyone’s word precessing is hyper textually linked to a larger network of texts and links.) Each of these shifts produced changes in the psyche: changes in the way we structure our thinking, the way we feel ourselves to be, and the way we engage and interact with the world and others. Ong writes,
    <blockquote><span class="r7 q4 link">Since at least the time of Hegel, awareness has been growing that human consciousness evolves … Modern studies in the shift from orality to literacy and the sequels of literacy, print and electronic processing of verbalization make more and more appearnt some of the ways this evolution has depended on writing. (178)</span></blockquote>
Heim, drawing on Ong, argues that “each historical shift in the symbolization of reality brings with it a restructuring of the psyche” and that the “entire human personality is configured anew with every shift in the dominant medium for preserving thought” (59), and he extends Ong’s insights more fully into digital writing and hypertext.
