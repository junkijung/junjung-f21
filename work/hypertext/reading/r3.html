<i>Hypermedia</i>, the other popular structure of new media, can also be seen as a particular case of the more general principle of variability. According to the definition by Halasz and Schwartz, hypermedia systems “provide their users with the ability to create, manipulate and/or examine a network of information-containing nodes interconnected by relational links.” Because in new media individual media elements (images, pages of text, etc.) always retain their individual identity (the principle of modularity), they can be “wired” together into more than one object. Hyperlinking is a particular way of achieving this into wiring. A hyperlink creates a connection between two elements, for example, between two words in two different pages or a sentence on one page and an image in another, or two different places within the same page.

While the 1990s’ Web browsers and other commercial cultural interfaces have retained the modern page format, they also have come to rely on a new way of organizing and accessing texts that has little precedent within the book tradition—hyperlinking. We may be tempted to trace hyperlinking to earlier forms and practices of non-sequential text organization, such as the Torah’s interpretations and footnotes, but it is actually fundamentally different from them. Both the Torah’s interpretations and footnotes imply a master-slave relationship between one text and another. But in the case of hyperlinking as implemented by HTML and earlier by Hypercard, no such relationship of hierarchy is assumed. The two sources connected through a hyperlink have equal weight; neither on dominates the other. Thus the acceptance of hyperlinking in the 1980s can be correlated with contemporary culture’s suspicion of all hierarchies, and preference for the aesthetics of collage in which radically different sources are brought together within a singular cultural object.
