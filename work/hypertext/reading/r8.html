    <p>The Term Hypertext</p>
At present the term <i>hypertext</i> refers both in theory and in practice to very different phenomena. In the most general sense, hypertext is simply a specific form of presentation characterized by the distribution of content to nodes or modules electronically connected vis links. The result is a network (see <span class="i6 link">fig. 6</span>).
The size and content of the network can vary considerably, giving rise to one of the many problems associated with defining hypertext. What exactly does the term hypertext refer to? How big or small is a hypertext? Hypertextually organized entities can range from extremely large networks (the World Wide Web) to far-reaching networks such as an interactive grammar system to very small entities like the restaurant menu represented at a company’s intranet. The content of a node can also be presented in a variety of ways (as text, graphics, animation, video, audio). The choice of content is dependent on the author’s intentions—hypertext nodes can, for example, consist solely of technical drawings.
<p>From a linguistic perspective, the interesting hypertext uses are those with a clearly recognizable communicative function. Hypertext will, therefore, be defined as an on- or offline accessible, functionally determined subnet of modules with a certain communicative purpose, organized by an overarching thematic idea (see Jakobs, 2003; Storrer, 2000). The two categories of function and theme provide a contextual framework for understanding parts of the network such as individual modules. This definition excludes collections of electronic artifacts like the World Wide Web. One of the most familiar examples of online accessible hypertext uses is the Web site.</p>

<p>The History of Hypertext and Web Sites.</p>
Like all forms of representation, hypertext has a history: The principle of shaping content in modular form and connecting it by way of cross-references has its roots in ideas and solutions that are relatively old. In print, the idea of a nonlinear linking of content is realized by footnotes and references to other texts; solutions like these can be traced at least as far back as the Middle Ages. However, the implementation of this idea as a holistic principle of presentation is relatively recent, its practical realization becoming possible only through the development of new technologies for the production, storage, distribution, and reception of information.
<p>Vannevar Bush is often considered to be the originator of this modern form. A professor at MIT at the age of 29 and later advisor to President Roosevelt, Bush was concerned with the problem of dealing with vast quantities of information. His starting point is what we now call “information overload.” In 1939, he recognized that there would soon be more printed information than any person would be able to manage. For Bush the problem was less the quantity of information than the lack or inadequacy of organizational and accessibility mechanisms. He thus developed the idea of a system that allowed users to have access to information directly from their desktop. In 1945 he described his ideas in the famous article “As We May Think” in the magazine <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>. The system called Memex (memory extender) is often seen as the forerunner of today’s hypertext but was itself never built. A camera attached to the user’s forehead was to record everything that came within the user’s field of vision (handwritten notes, printed texts, pictures, etc.) This data was then to be stored in microfilm (microfiche) and made accessible via a kind of optical screen. The ordering of the data was to be provided by an associative indexing that permitted the user to mimic human memory by laying down associative trails through the data that could be forwarded to other users. This access was to be individualized: Users were to have the possibility of altering texts, inserting commentaries, or producing links between documents.</p>
<p>Bush’s visionary idea was not technically feasible at the time. This became possible only with a new generation of technology. One of the most important technical pioneers is Douglas C. Engelbart, who between 1962 and 1975 developed the AUGMENT (later called NLS) system at the Stanford Research Institute. One fundamental feature of AUGMENT was that users could build links among documents and share each other’s links. The hypertext-like system supported cooperative work in an electronic environment. The system was intended to allow distributed publishing and editing, electronic document delivery, and teleconferencing, among other features. AUGMENT used technical tools now standard on the personal computer such as the mouse, multiple windows, and a graphic interface.</p>
    <p>Ted Nelson is considered one of the most important hypertext pioneers. In 1965 he coined the terms <i>hypertext</i> and <i>hypermedia</i>. Nelson sought to develop the idea of a universal knowledge-management and information-production system, which he called XANADU(see <span class="i5 link">fig.5</span>). XANADU was based on the idea of replacing the physical presence of information at the workplace by logical links to spatially distributed forms of memory storage accessible to the user when needed. This information could be verbal, visual, or auditory. The aim was to transform the entire conventional publication system into a global hypertext network that makes all published information available to everyone and enable users to freely recombine any and all documents and add their own content.</p>
<p>The first functioning hypertext system with links originated in the late 1960s and was named HES (Hypertext Editing System). In 1978, A. Lippmen developed the first hypermedia system, ASPEN-MOVIE-MAP, which simulated a trip through the city of Aspen. The deveolopment of the program “Guide” in 1986 and later “Hypercard” enabled the transition from research to practical applications. Widespread use was made possible by increasingly easier-to-use software and possibilities afforded by the Internet.</p>
