  Welcome to Jun’s Utopias! To give you a sense of what my Utopias are like, it would be worth mentioning that my Utopias would best fit those who got sick and tired of working in urban areas, as I am the kind of person who loves tranquility and nature. Even though there are no tourist attractions in my Utopias, surrounded by absolute silence and solitude, you may be able to reflect on what you have been missing in your life.

    <p>Now I will walk you through my Utopias.
      Please try to imagine how the places would be like while I narrate my experience.<br><br>
      My first Utopia is located at around 73 degrees East longitude and 5 degrees North latitude.
      The weather in this place is mild all year round, and it has helped me look on the bright side of things.
      Because the weather makes its environment almost identical to that of a mother’s womb, I was worry-free and did not think about how I could survive in capitalistic societies.
      Rather, it felt like I could sustain my life with the given nature.
      I started considering everyday as a gift and was able to enjoy life as it is.
      <br><br>
      In this Utopia, I saw oceans more often than lands, and therefore had to be ready to swim or tan anytime.
      When I dove into the water, I could see corals, tropical fishes, and occasionally baby sharks.
      The color of ocean on the surface is deep blue, emerald, or reflective of the sky, while under the water, variegated colors caught my attention.
      As I immersed myself in the water, I forgot where I should go next and let my body flow with the water current.
      <br><br>
      At the crack of dawn, I saw people doing Yoga in the rising sun.
      I sat down between them without saying anything, and they did not ask me anything about myself, but just smiled and handed me a Yoga mat that they brought.
      Among the people, there was a Yoga teacher who can only speak in her mother tongue. She taught me Yoga poses using her body as a language.
      The sunshine was directed towards us, as if we were the main actors of the play known as life in this world. 
      While I practiced Yoga, people didn’t talk to one another, respecting one another and paying full attention to its meditative moments.
      The air was so fresh that inhaling and exhaling infused my body with vitality.
      I wondered why we should make such a great effort
